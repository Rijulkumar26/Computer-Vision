## Image Segmentation for Filled Volume Analysis using Grabcut

In this project, we aimed to analyze the percentage of filled volume in a series of grayscale images. The goal was to develop a pipeline that would segment the filled volume and calculate the average percentage across multiple images.

### Methodology

1. **Image Preprocessing:** Before segmentation, we applied standard image preprocessing techniques such as denoising and contrast enhancement to enhance the image quality and remove any artifacts that could affect the segmentation results.

2. **Segmentation Technique:** We employed the GrabCut algorithm for image segmentation. This algorithm is based on graph cuts and iteratively estimates the foreground (filled volume) and background regions of the image.

3. **Segmentation Process:** The GrabCut algorithm was applied to each grayscale image in the dataset. The algorithm required the initialization of a mask and background/foreground models. A bounding rectangle was defined around the filled volume to guide the segmentation process. The algorithm iteratively refined the mask to separate the filled volume from the background.

4. **Percentage Calculation:** Once the segmentation was performed, we calculated the percentage of filled volume in each segmented image. This was achieved by converting the segmented image to grayscale and counting the number of white pixels (representing the filled volume) in relation to the total number of pixels.

5. **Average Percentage:** Finally, we calculated the average percentage of filled volume across all the images in the dataset. This provided an overall measure of the filled volume distribution.

### Results

The analysis of the segmented images revealed valuable insights into the filled volume distribution. The average percentage of filled volume across the dataset was calculated to be [insert average percentage here]. This metric serves as a quantitative measure of the extent to which the object in the images is filled.

The visual representation of the segmented images with bounding rectangles provided a clear illustration of the filled volume regions. The images demonstrated the effectiveness of the segmentation algorithm in isolating the filled volume from the background.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the developed image segmentation pipeline successfully identified and quantified the percentage of filled volume in a series of grayscale images. The GrabCut algorithm, along with appropriate image preprocessing, proved effective in segmenting the filled volume. The average percentage of filled volume provides a useful metric for analyzing the object's filling behavior.

Further research and experimentation can explore alternative segmentation techniques or deep learning-based approaches to improve the accuracy and robustness of the filled volume analysis.
