# Image Processing Analysis for Container and Filled Matter Circumference

## Introduction
In this report, we present an analysis of an image using various image processing techniques to extract information about the circumference and dimensions of a container and the filled matter within it. The analysis includes steps such as foreground extraction, edge detection, contour finding, and fitting of ellipses.

## Methodology
The image processing analysis was performed using the following steps:

### Data Preparation
- Importing necessary libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Imutils.
- Configuring the required libraries and suppressing warning messages.

### Foreground Extraction
- Reading the input image using OpenCV.
- Defining a mask and initializing background and foreground models.
- Specifying a rectangular region of interest (ROI) for the container.
- Applying the GrabCut algorithm to extract the foreground from the image.
- Displaying the extracted foreground image.

### Edge Detection
- Converting the foreground image to grayscale.
- Applying Gaussian blurring to reduce noise in the image.
- Plotting a histogram to analyze the pixel intensity distribution.
- Applying Canny edge detection to detect edges in the blurred image.

### Contour Finding and Visualization
- Finding contours in the edge image using the OpenCV `findContours()` function.
- Drawing all the contours on a copy of the original image.
- Filtering the contours based on their area using a threshold value.
- Computing the convex hull for the filtered contours.
- Drawing the enclosing curves (ellipse and convex hull) on separate copies of the image.
- Visualizing the drawn contours and ellipses.

### Measurement Extraction
- Extracting the dimensions (major and minor axis lengths) of the ellipse enclosing the convex hull.
- Printing the dimensions to provide insights into the size of the container.

### Circumference Analysis of Filled Matter
- Applying a different area threshold to filter contours representing the filled matter.
- Computing the convex hull for the filtered filled matter contours.
- Drawing the enclosing curve of the filled matter using the convex hull.
- Fitting an ellipse to the filled matter contours and visualizing it.

### Volume Ratio Calculation
- Calculating the ratio of the volumes of the container and filled matter based on known radius values and the volume formula for a cone.

## Results
- The image processing analysis successfully extracted the foreground, detected edges, and found contours.
- The enclosing curves (ellipse and convex hull) provided insights into the shape and size of the container and the filled matter.
- The dimensions of the ellipse enclosing the convex hull were obtained, offering information about the major and minor axis lengths.
- The drawn ellipse and convex hull accurately represented the circumference of the filled matter.
- The volume ratio between the container and the filled matter was calculated based on known radius values.

## Conclusion
The image processing analysis allowed us to gain valuable insights into the circumference and dimensions of the container and the filled matter. The use of techniques such as GrabCut, Canny edge detection, contour finding, and ellipse fitting provided accurate measurements and visual representations of the objects of interest. The obtained volume ratio between the container and the filled matter contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the contents and their relative sizes.

## Future Improvements
- Further optimizations can be explored to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the image processing algorithms used.
- Additional analysis techniques such as color segmentation or deep learning models could be incorporated to improve the analysis results.
- More comprehensive experiments on diverse images and scenarios can be conducted to validate the approach's effectiveness.
